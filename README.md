# Gluon

[![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/fa66a8ec0534402cab56480d4819328f)](https://app.codacy.com/gh/cmourglia/gluon-cpp?utm_source=github.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=cmourglia/gluon-cpp&utm_campaign=Badge_Grade_Settings)

Gluon is an attempt to address an issue with application development where software are usually bloated and very inefficient (look how quickly your mail or calendar application gets rid of your battery when using it) and managers do not allow people to take performance into account, because "it's expensive".

The objective is to provide a framework that allows front-end developers to write code quickly and easily using the expressiveness of a declarative language (while trying to avoid the pitfalls of e.g. QML or Flutter at the same times) but also gives lightweight and energy efficient results.
